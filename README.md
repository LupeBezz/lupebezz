### Hi there 👋

##I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in graphic design and architecture.

Web development is a great opportunity to learn lots of exciting technical skills and merge them with my design experience, resulting in a unique blend that takes advantage of all my abilities.

These are the technologies I have been using the most:

HTML | CSS | Javascript <br />
React + Redux | Vue | jQuery <br />
Node.js | Express <br />
Postgre SQL <br />
Aws | Heroku | GitHub <br />
