### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in graphic design and architecture.

Web development is a great opportunity to learn lots of exciting technical skills and merge them with my design experience, resulting in a unique blend that takes advantage of all my abilities.

I am currently searching for a new work environment in Berlin that challenges me and provides a learning platform to further improve my skills.  These are the technologies I have been using the most:

HTML | CSS | Javascript
React + Redux | Vue | jQuery
Node.js | Express
Postgre SQL
Aws | Heroku | GitHub
